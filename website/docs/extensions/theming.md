Stratos provides a mechanism for customizing the theme, including:

- Changing colors
- Changing image assets (favorite icon, login background and logo)
- Using additional fonts
- Adding/Overriding styles
- Applying theme colors to components

Theme's are best encapsulated in a new npm package. It should contain the usual `package.json` file with a `stratos` section which will contain some of the theme customizations.

An example of the type of package that can be created can be found in the [ACME example](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/tree/master/src/frontend/packages/example-theme). To run Stratos with these customizations see [here](./introduction#acme).

## Colors
Stratos uses Material Design and the [angular-material](https://material.angular.io/) library and uses the same approach to theming.

To create your own theme you will need to create a color pallet and provide it to Stratos as a material theme. This theme can also contain
additional colors that customize core parts of the page (header, side navigator menu, avatar, etc).

To do this create the file `_index.scss` in the root of your theme package. This should contain a Stratos scss function that will return a `theme`
object via the Stratos helper function `stratos-theme-helper`, for [example](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/blob/master/src/frontend/packages/example-theme/_index.scss). 

### Core Pallet
In most cases you will probably want to generate a palette for the primary color for your version of Stratos - an example `custom.scss` for this is shown below:

```
$acme-primary: (50: #e8eaf6, 100: #c5cbe9, 200: #9fa8da, 300: #7985cb, 400: #5c6bc0, 500: #3f51b5, 600: #394aae, 700: #3140a5, 800: #29379d, 900: #1b278d, A100: #c6cbff, A200: #939dff, A400: #606eff, A700: #4757ff, contrast: (  50: #000000,  100: #000000,  200: #000000,  300: #000000,  400: #ffffff,  500: #ffffff,  600: #ffffff,  700: #ffffff,  800: #ffffff,  900: #ffffff,  A100: #000000,  A200: #000000,  A400: #ffffff,  A700: #ffffff, ));
$mat-red: ( 50: #ffebee, 100: #ffcdd2, 200: #ef9a9a, 300: #e57373, 400: #ef5350, 500: #f44336, 600: #e53935, 700: #d32f2f, 800: #c62828, 900: #b71c1c, A100: #ff8a80, A200: #ff5252, A400: #ff1744, A700: #d50000, contrast: ( 50: $black-87-opacity, 100: $black-87-opacity, 200: $black-87-opacity, 300: $black-87-opacity, 400: $black-87-opacity, 500: white, 600: white, 700: white, 800: $white-87-opacity, 900: $white-87-opacity, A100: $black-87-opacity, A200: white, A400: white, A700: white, ));

// Create palettes
$acme-theme-primary: mat-palette($acme-primary);
$acme-theme-warn: mat-palette($mat-red);

// Create a theme from the palette (secondary theme is the same as the primary in this example)
$stratos-theme: mat-light-theme($acme-theme-primary, $acme-theme-primary, $acme-theme-warn);

// Create a similar theme but make it for dark mode
$stratos-dark-theme: mat-dark-theme($acme-theme-primary, $acme-theme-primary, $acme-theme-warn);

```

### Stratos Colors

Additional Stratos colors can be customized by supplying more colors to the `theme` object. Defining these colors helps reduce the amount of custom css the theme has to use.

> You do not have to specify all of these - defaults will be used if they are not set.

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|app-background-color| Base color to show in the background of the application |
|app-background-text-color| Color of text when placed on the basic background |

### Dark theme

By default the theme will not contain a dark mode and the UX for enabled/disabling it will be hidden.

In order to add a dark mode to your theme an additional `dark` color theme should be provided by the `stratos-theme` theme function in your
theme's `_index.scss`, for example 
in [_index.scss](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/blob/master/src/frontend/packages/example-theme/_index.scss).

```
@function stratos-theme() {
  $theme: stratos-theme-helper($stratos-theme);
  @return (
    default: create-custom-theme($stratos-theme),
    dark: create-dark-theme()
  );
}
```

Within the dark theme the default theme's additional Stratos colors can be overwritten.


## Images

### Replace Stratos Images




Images that Stratos uses can be overwritten by a theme, for example the logo and favicon. To do so the new images should be added to the
package and then referenced in the theme's `package.json` including the path of the image they overwrite. Below are some prominent examples.


|File name|Path|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`favicon.ico`|`favicon.ico`|Favorite icon to use|
|`logo.png`|`core/assets/logo.png`|Logo to use on login screen and about page|
|`nav-logo.png`|`core/assets/nav-logo.png`|Logo to use in the top-left side navigation for the application logo|


> The `nav-logo.png` logo should have a height of 36px and a maximum width of 180 pixels.

> Files written to `core/assets` should be done in one line. In the example below both logo.png and nav-logo.png and done via the one
> line

Example `package.json`

```
  "stratos": {
    ...
    "assets": {
      "assets/core": "core/assets",
      "assets/favicon.ico": "favicon.ico",
    },
    ...
  },
```

### New Images

When images are used by custom components they should also be referenced in the theme's `package.json`. Whole folders can be included and should
be written to `core/assets`. When references by the components they use that path `src="/core/assets/custom_image.png"`

```
  "stratos": {
    ...
    "assets": {
      "local/assets": "core/assets",
    },
    ...
  },
```

## Fonts
Any custom fonts used by the theme or extensions can be provided in a similar way to images, the files should be added to the theme's package
and then referenced in the theme's `package.json`.

```
  "stratos": {
    "assets": {
      ...
      "assets/fonts": "suse/fonts"
      ...
  },
```

## Styles

We don't generally recommend modifying styles, since from version to version of Stratos, we may change the styles used slightly which can mean any modifications you made will need updating. Should you wish to do so, you can modify these in the same `_index_.scss`. For example the Acme[_index.scss](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stratos/blob/master/src/frontend/packages/example-theme/_index.scss) imports a file that adds a text color 

```
body.stratos {
  .favorite-list {
    .app-no-content-container {
      color: $acme-dark-blue;
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the class `stratos` has been placed on the `BODY` tag of the Stratos application to assist with css selector specificity.

## Components

Angular components in your packages can be themed, which provides them access to the theme's colors. To do this, in your extensions package that contains the components (this may be different to your theme package), add a `_all-theme.scss` file containing a scss function. This function
should be referenced in the package's package.json and is called by the Stratos extension mechanism.

The `_all-theme.scss` and `package.json` content may look like below

```
@mixin apply-theme-suse-extensions($stratos-theme) {

  $theme: map-get($stratos-theme, theme);
  $app-theme: map-get($stratos-theme, app-theme);

}
```

```
  "stratos": {
    ...
    "theming": "sass/_all-theme#apply-theme-suse-extensions",
    ...
  }
```

Component theme files can then be defined and their own scss functions being called from `_all-theme.scss`

```
@mixin apply-theme-suse-extensions($stratos-theme) {
  ...
  @include kube-analysis-report-theme($theme, $app-theme);
  ...
}
```

```
@mixin kube-analysis-report-theme($theme, $app-theme) {
  $backgrounds: map-get($theme, background);
  $background: mat-color($backgrounds, card);
  $background-color:  map-get($app-theme, app-background-color);
}
```
